### What the project does
A "simple" Python script, which, if run within Blender will read a list[csv file] of stars and convert the location [Right Acsention and Declanation] in to angle location to plotte the star as 3D objects on a imaginary spherical surface. Creating a celestrial sphere.

### Why the project is useful
It is one of my first Python projects, which has taught me a lot and still to this day brings me always back to it to figure more out about the Blender Python API and Python.
This is also my first project published on Github. I hope it can inspire you and help me to learn more.
