What the project does
A "simple" python script which if run within Blender will read a list[csv file] of stars and convert the location [Right Acsention and Declanation] in to angle location to plotte the star as 3D objects on a imaginary spherical surface. Creating a celestrial sphere.

Why the project is useful
It is one of my first python projects, which has taught me a lot and still to this day brings me always back to it to figure more about the Blender Python API out.
This is also my first project published on Github. I hope it can inspire you and help me to learn more.
